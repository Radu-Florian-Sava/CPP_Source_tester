# Project notes

The project requires a C++ compiler which for Windows can be found at `https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/`

In its current phase, the project uses the g++.exe compiler from [GNU](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe/download)
